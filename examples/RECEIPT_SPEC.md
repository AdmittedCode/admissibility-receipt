# StegVerse Admissibility Receipt — v1

Canonical, ecosystem-wide receipt. One envelope that the existing emitters
(TVC, StegCore, StegCGE, StegDB) map into, plus the fields required to survive
independent, legal, and adversarial scrutiny. This is the artifact every
AdmittedCode product ships per release.

## Design rules

1. A receipt claims **only what was evaluated**. The `scope` block is mandatory
   and states both what is asserted and what is NOT. A receipt without an honest
   scope is invalid.
2. A receipt is **independently re-verifiable**: it carries the recompute anchor
   (`verification.replay_hash` / `merkle_root`) and the exact
   `canonicalization` method, so any implementation in any language can confirm
   it. This is what makes it device/OS/language-agnostic.
3. **Authority and enforcement are distinct and bound**: the enforcement block
   carries the `decision_fingerprint` it acted on, so the two halves cannot be
   spliced.
4. The evaluating **engines are pinned** (name + version + hash), so the
   evaluation itself is reproducible against the same logic later.

## Field-mapping from existing emitters

| v1 field | TVC secret-read | StegCore | StegCGE | StegDB cleanup |
|----------|-----------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `decision.decision` | `admissible` (bool→ALLOW/DENY) | `decision` | route | n/a (action) |
| `decision.reason_code` | `reasons[0]` | `reason_code` | — | `detection` |
| `decision.fingerprint` | `decision_id` | (derive) | — | — |
| `authority_evidence.tvc_policy_hash` | `policy_hash` | — | — | — |
| `verification.replay_hash` | — | — | `final_state_hash` | — |
| `verification.merkle_root` | — | — | `build_merkle_tree` root | — |
| `previous_receipt_hash` | — | — | `parent_hash` | (chainlog) |
| `timestamp_utc` | `ts` | — | — | `ts` |
| `scope` | **new** | **new** | **new** | **new** |
| `canonicalization` | **new** | **new** | **new** | **new** |

Two fields (`scope`, `canonicalization`) are new to all emitters — they are the
additions that make the receipt survive legal and cross-implementation scrutiny.

## The five gaps this closes (vs. the draft envelope)

1. `verification.{merkle_root,replay_hash,reverify_command}` — gives Scrutiny #1
   something concrete to recompute.
2. `canonicalization` — pins the bytes-to-hash so any language reproduces it.
3. `scope` — states what the receipt does and does NOT prove (Scrutiny #2).
4. `decision.engine_version/hash` + `enforcement.manager_version/hash` — pins the
   evaluating logic so the evaluation is reproducible (Scrutiny #3).
5. `enforcement.enacted_decision_fingerprint` — binds enforcement to the specific
   decision it enacted (anti-splice).
